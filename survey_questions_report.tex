\chapter{Internal validity survey results\label{app:survey-results}}

We consider only the pairs for which there were 10 or more responses.The survey respondents were asked how much they agreed with the following statement:

\begin{displayquote}
\emph{Paragraph A is more readable than paragraph B.}
\end{displayquote}

To simplify analysis of the results, each pair in the results dataset has been swapped (if needed) so that Paragraph A is indeed more readable than paragraph B, meaning that there has been a readability decrease between the two versions. Survey responses have of course been swapped too when necessary.

This means that for all questions, we expect the respondents to agree with the statement (and thus select "Strongly agree" or "Somewhat agree").

\paragraph{Paragraph A}
After obtaining all the commits with refactoring operations, we filtered out commits involved in which more than one refactoring type was applied, again to better isolate and study the effect of a single type of refactoring operation on the code naturalness. In the end, we obtained 1,448 refactoring operations from 619 projects, while no relevant refactorings are detected in the other 881 projects.\par\medskip\emph{Flesch reading ease}: 11.415000000000019\par\emph{Flesch---Kincaid grade}: 19.120000000000005

In most cases, a change occurred in a comment update (113), while in a few cases (12) a new comment was added. For updates, which were in most cases closely related to an inconsistency, we observed three main reasons why developers updated comments: (i) the comment was wrong before (35) (i.e., it was already wrong when it was first added, or it became outdated after a change), (ii) they updated the comment together/following a new implementation (25), (iii) they wanted to explain the actual implementation (53) in more detail.\par\medskip\emph{Flesch reading ease}: 17.599302325581423\par\emph{Flesch---Kincaid grade}: 21.486976744186048

In most cases, the change occurred in the form of a comment update (113), while in a few cases (12) a new comment was added. We observed three main reasons why developers update comments: (i) the comment wrongly describes the application logic (35), due to an error done when the comment was written in the first place or to an inconsistency introduced during the code evolution (in these cases we were not able to trace back to the specific cause of the problem); (ii) the comment needs to be updated as a consequence of a new implementation logic (25); (iii) the comment is improved to explain the actual implementation in more details (53).\par\medskip\emph{Flesch reading ease}: 12.591666666666667\par\emph{Flesch---Kincaid grade}: 24.918148148148152

Although these types of changes are typically not due to code-comment inconsistencies, we found cases where the comment contained references to other source code elements, or links to, for instance, bug reports. These cases can be considered dangerous from the inconsistency point of view, hence, we marked these as well in the taxonomy.\par\medskip\emph{Flesch reading ease}: 38.43000000000001\par\emph{Flesch---Kincaid grade}: 14.60666666666667

Although these types of changes are usually not performed because of code-comment inconsistencies, we found cases where the comment contained references, for example, to other source code elements or bug reports. These cases can be considered dangerous from an inconsistency point of view, as invalid/outdated references can be disturbing in the code. For example in Google Guava a commit says: "Updated a comment in ListenerCallQueue to point at SequentialExecutor instead of the deprecated SerializingExecutor wrapper interface".\par\medskip\emph{Flesch reading ease}: 7.991153846153878\par\emph{Flesch---Kincaid grade}: 18.60384615384616
