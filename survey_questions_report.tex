\chapter{Internal validity survey results\label{app:survey-results}}

We consider only the pairs for which there were 10 or more responses.The survey respondents were asked how much they agreed with the following statement:

\begin{displayquote}
\emph{Paragraph A is more readable than paragraph B.}
\end{displayquote}

To simplify analysis of the results, each pair in the results dataset has been swapped (if needed) so that Paragraph A is indeed more readable than paragraph B, meaning that there has been a readability decrease between the two versions. Survey responses have of course been swapped too when necessary.

This means that for all questions, we expect the respondents to agree with the statement (and thus select "Strongly agree" or "Somewhat agree").

\paragraph{Paragraph A}
After obtaining all the commits with refactoring operations, we filtered out commits involved in which more than one refactoring type was applied, again to better isolate and study the effect of a single type of refactoring operation on the code naturalness. In the end, we obtained 1,448 refactoring operations from 619 projects, while no relevant refactorings are detected in the other 881 projects.\par\medskip

While in the cases we analyzed the issue was spotted and fixed quickly by the developer, there might be non-trivial cases in which only a subset of the test suite is executed for regression testing (e.g., due to a limited testing budget) and a non-executed broken test is not identified by the developer. For researchers, this is an opportunity to study test breaking-changes and to develop techniques able to alert the developer when a change she implemented might require a double check of (part of) the test suite. For practitioners, continuous integration practices can help in timely spotting these issues in most of cases.\par\medskip

To mitigate subjectivity bias in such a process, every commit was assigned to two authors who manually analyzed it independently. Then, in the case of a disagreement, a third author was assigned to the commit to solve the conflict.\par\medskip

However, the main purpose of those code refactoring/clean up tasks is to improve the code understandability. Variable and method renaming refactoring (i.e., renaming a variable or method to better reflect its functionality) is the most common way to make the code easier to comprehend. Also popular are code transformations aimed at replacing literal values with variables or splitting long functions through extract method refactoring. The latter allows not only to foster comprehensibility, but also the reusability of small code snippets.\par\medskip

However, the main purpose of those code refactoring/clean up tasks is to improve the code comprehensibility without touching any documentation. Variable and method renaming refactoring (i.e., renaming a variable or method to better fit its functionality) is the most common way to make the code easier to understand. Also, variable and method extract refactoring (i.e., replacing literal values or inner method code blocks by introducing new variables or methods) is a standard approach to not only avoid existing or potential redundant code, but also better present and explain the implementation logic of the extracted code snippets.\par\medskip

Sojer and Henkel focused on the legal and economic risks of code reuse from the Internet. They surveyed 869 professional software developers to investigate if the reuse of code snippets from internet is a common practice in commercial software development. They found that the 88% developers reuse internet code and the 19% of them consider reuse as a very important activity for their work. Furthermore, the analysis shows a growth in the importance of internet code reuse in recent years.\par\medskip

For instance, in a commit of QR Code generator a comment describing how an array element of the QR code is calculated was fixed (following a copy-paste mistake). In WordPress for Android, the previously misleading comment of the "getPath()" method was replaced from "descendants must implement this to send their specific request to the stats api" to "descendants must implement this to return their specific path to the stats rest api". We also observed interesting cases when the fix was in an example code inside the comment (see).\par\medskip

In most cases, a change occurred in a comment update (113), while in a few cases (12) a new comment was added. For updates, which were in most cases closely related to an inconsistency, we observed three main reasons why developers updated comments: (i) the comment was wrong before (35) (i.e., it was already wrong when it was first added, or it became outdated after a change), (ii) they updated the comment together/following a new implementation (25), (iii) they wanted to explain the actual implementation (53) in more detail.\par\medskip

In most cases, the change occurred in the form of a comment update (113), while in a few cases (12) a new comment was added. We observed three main reasons why developers update comments: (i) the comment wrongly describes the application logic (35), due to an error done when the comment was written in the first place or to an inconsistency introduced during the code evolution (in these cases we were not able to trace back to the specific cause of the problem); (ii) the comment needs to be updated as a consequence of a new implementation logic (25); (iii) the comment is improved to explain the actual implementation in more details (53).\par\medskip

Although these types of changes are typically not due to code-comment inconsistencies, we found cases where the comment contained references to other source code elements, or links to, for instance, bug reports.

Although these types of changes are usually not performed because of code-comment inconsistencies, we found cases where the comment contained references, for example, to other source code elements or bug reports. These cases can be considered dangerous from an inconsistency point of view, as invalid/outdated references can be disturbing in the code.

Example: The incompleteness could raise from different things such as missing explanation (e.g.,**"is there any idea what "frequently used" might mean?"), a component in a library (e.g.,**"The documentation on [...] is missing information about the toolbar buttons"), API behavior clarification (e.g.,**"I think that we should add documentation ensuring that the user passes a tree with reset bounds"), or compatibility information (e.g.,**"Explicitly mention if clang 4.x, 5.x are supported").

(Empirical) Studies. Software documentation has been analyzed in diverse empirical studies that (i) report evidence of its importance and impact in the software life cycle, (ii) describe problems that developers face when dealing with it, (iii) list quality attributes required in documentation, (iv) provide recommendations for constructing it (including standards), and (v) propose frameworks and tools for evaluating documentation concerns such as cost, benefit and quality attributes. Due to space limitations we summarize the closest ones to our study in Table [tab:related\_SwTechDocWorks].\par\medskip

Referring to deprecated information is another reason for up-to-dateness issues and can affect several types of documentation in different ways. It includes having deprecated information in the project's website (e.g.,**"homepage recommends deprecated commands"), outdated copyright information and version numbers in the code base, as well as outdated references (e.g., links to old versions of the system in the documentation), which was the most prevalent issue within this category. For example, one user reported that "the example linked in the documentation is using the 3.x version of the API, and that may be confusing to readers".\par\medskip

Interestingly, in another thread of the Apache httpd mailing list they discuss an issue of harmful warning messages originating from meta-information they also use to enforce up-to-dateness of different translations.

However, we found one case in Apache httpd documentation mailing list where the traceability information between translations of a document was still managed manually, e.g., by adding a line of comment at top of translations referring to original document and more particularly "The whole point of the comment is to see which exact revisions of the original file you have to diff to see the changes.".\par\medskip

For example, some projects have added documentation up-to-dateness as one of the items to check in the contribution to-do list, and others have pushed this forward by making Javadoc update mandatory for pull request acceptance.\par\medskip
