Variable and method renaming refactoring (i.e., renaming a variable or method to better reflect its functionality) is the most common way to make the code easier to comprehend. Also popular are code transformations aimed at replacing literal values with variables or splitting long functions through extract method refactoring. The latter allows not only to foster comprehensibility, but also the reusability of small code snippets."}},{"_id":"5eb23451deb70a6af224d977","documentRepoId":"5eb233e3deb70a6af2233f53","documentRepoName":"research-fengcai-icpc2020","fkglDelta":4.51,"freDelta":-25.210000000000008,"from":{"commitAuthorEmail":"gabriele.bavota@gmail.com","commitId":"5eb2341bdeb70a6af223d61d","readability":{"daleChallScore":18.408266666666666,"fleschKincaidGradeLevel":7.400000000000002,"fleschReadingEase":52.69500000000002,"papersDomainScore":11.8291},"text":"::: {#tab:dataset}\n|                   |             |         |        |           |\n|------------------:|------------:|--------:|-------:|----------:|\n|                   |             |         |        |           |\n|                   |             |     Mean|  Median|  Std.

This latter scenario might result in the introduction of code-comment inconsistencies, manifesting when the source code does not co-evolve with the related comments. For example, if a method comment is not updated after major changes to the method's application logic, the comment might provide misleading information to developers comprehending the method, hindering program comprehension rather than fostering it. Given the potential harmfulness of code-comment inconsistencies, several researchers studied the co-evolution of code and comments, while others proposed techniques and tools able to detect code-comment inconsistencies automatically. These techniques are able to identify specific types of code-comment inconsistencies. For example, @TCOMMENT detects inconsistencies between Javadoc comments related to null values and exceptions with the behavior implemented in the related method's body, while Fraco focuses on inconsistencies introduced as result of rename refactoring operations. Still, more research is needed in this area to increase the types of code-comment inconsistencies that can be automatically identified. Also, the empirical evidence provided by studies that pioneered the investigation of code-comment evolution is limited to the analysis of the change history of a few software systems (less than 10)."}},{"_id":"5eb23455deb70a6af2250ab9","documentRepoId":"5eb233e4deb70a6af2233f55","documentRepoName":"research-fengcai-icpc2019","fkglDelta":0.5647696749932862,"freDelta":-6.275488517324732,"from":{"commitAuthorEmail":"gabriele.bavota@gmail.com","commitId":"5eb233fedeb70a6af223852b","readability":{"daleChallScore":12.653001369863016,"fleschKincaidGradeLevel":14.885034246575344,"fleschReadingEase":20.849606164383573,"papersDomainScore":7.786220547945206},"text":"We present the results in the form of a hierarchical taxonomy that can be seen in FigureÂ [fig:taxonomy].

Jiang and Hassan conducted a study on the evolution of comments in PostgreSQL. They investigated the trend of the percentage of commented functions in PostgreSQL over time. They divided comments into header comments and non-header comments according to the relative location of a comment with its associated function. By investigating how many header comments and non-header comments were added and deleted during the evolutionary history of PostgreSQL, their result reveals the proportion of commented functions remains constant over time. Fluri et al. conducted an empirical research on three open source systems (ArgoUML, Azureus, and JDT Core) to study how comments and source code co-evolved over time. They observed that 97% of comment changes triggered by source code changes were done in the same revision as the associated source code change, but newly added code barely got commented. In this study, an algorithm called ChangeDistiller was proposed to track fine-grained code changes down to the statement level as well as the comment changes. In Fluri's other paper, an similar approach was proposed to investigate the co-evolution between code and comment with experiments on multiple revisions of eight different software systems. They found that the ratio between the growth of code and comments is constant, however, newly added code still barely trigger the addition of comments in half of the investigated systems. The type of code entity highly influences whether the entity is commented or not. For example, if-statements are commented more often than simple statements. They also found that over 50% of the comment changes are related to source code changes and 90% of these comment changes co-evolve with the code changes simultaneously on the observed systems. Arafat et al. looked at the density of comments, which is defined as the number of comment lines divided by the number of lines of code of the same code body, in 5,229 open source projects in different programming languages. Their research indicated that successful open source projects follow a consistent practice of documenting their source code and it has led to an average comment density of about 19%. Indeed, the average comment density is dependent with programming language (the highest mean density is 25% on Java projects) but remains constant on two other dimensions such as projects size and team size."},"to":{"commitAuthorEmail":"gabriele.bavota@gmail.com","commitId":"5eb233f1deb70a6af2235826","readability":{"daleChallScore":12.367271396895788,"fleschKincaidGradeLevel":10.94649667405765,"fleschReadingEase":43.13641906873616,"papersDomainScore":8.323490909090909},"text":"Fluri etÂ al. conducted an empirical research on three open source systems (ArgoUML, Azureus, and JDT Core) to study how comments and source code co-evolved over time.

We invited developers and CS students/professors to take part in our study by using a Web application we developed to perform the following steps. First, we collected demographic data about participants (years of experience in programming, in Java, and in Android, their current position, etc.). Each participant was then required to assess the correctness of all clones identified by ASIA for eight snippets randomly selected from the 40 object of this study. The Web application was designed to automatically balance the number of evaluations for each of the 40 snippets (i.e., the number of participants assessing the correctness of each identified clone was roughly the same). In total, we collected 501 evaluations across the 182 clones of the 39 snippets (2.78(??) evaluations per clone on average). The eight snippets were presented individually (i.e., each snippet in a different page) to participants, and each clone identified by ASIA for it was shown below the snippet with two radio buttons allowing the participant to express her assessment as: it is a clone or it is not a clone. We instructed participants to consider a clone as a true positive not only if it represented an exact copy of the related snippet (type-1 clone), but also if it differed for variable renaming (type-2), for the addition/deletion of few lines of code do not changing the main feature implemented in the snippet (type-3), or even if it represented a totally different implementation of the same functionality (type-4).

In the second survey, we studied the types of documentation that practitioners consider important given specific tasks.

We start from the work by Aghajani et al. to assess the relevance of the documentation issues presented in their taxonomy, something completely neglected in their work.

Inspecting 803 discussions, we grouped these into Maintainability, Readability, Usability, and Usefulness issues, however, there are many other types of issues mentioned in the literature (e.g., see Zhi et al.). As our analysis reveals, a major part of the reported issues was related to simple typos or grammatical mistakes, but these were not considered harmful. Serious problems were these which affected the usefulness or the usability of the documentation, particularly those arising from lousy information organization or affecting the findability of the information.
