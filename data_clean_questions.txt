[[Question:Text]]
<div>This study is about text readability in the context of software engineering papers.</div>
<div>You will be presented with pairs of paragraphs, and for each pair you will have to state how much you agree with a statement regarding their readability.</div>
<br/>
<div>The <strong>readability</strong> of a text indicates how easy it is to read.</div>
<div>It is the <strong>ease of reading</strong> created by the choice of content, style, design, and organization that fit the prior knowledge, reading skill, interest, and motivation of the audience.</div>
<br/>
<div>Readability is <strong>not</strong> to be confused with legibility, which is more concerned with the visual perception and the layout of the text.</div>

<div>However, the main purpose of those code refactoring/clean up tasks is to improve the code comprehensibility without touching any documentation. Variable and method renaming refactoring (i.e., renaming a variable or method to better fit its functionality) is the most common way to make the code easier to understand. Also, variable and method extract refactoring (i.e., replacing literal values or inner method code blocks by introducing new variables or methods) is a standard approach to not only avoid existing or potential redundant code, but also better present and explain the implementation logic of the extracted code snippets.</div>

Variable and method renaming refactoring (i.e., renaming a variable or method to better reflect its functionality) is the most common way to make the code easier to comprehend. Also popular are code transformations aimed at replacing literal values with variables or splitting long functions through extract method refactoring. The latter allows not only to foster comprehensibility, but also the reusability of small code snippets.</div>

<div>While in the cases we analyzed the issue was spotted and fixed quickly by the developer, there might be non-trivial cases in which only a subset of the test suite is executed for regression testing (e.g., due to a limited testing budget) and a non-executed broken test is not identified by the developer. For researchers, this is an opportunity to study test breaking-changes and to develop techniques able to alert the developer when a change she implemented might require a double check of (part of) the test suite. For practitioners, continuous integration practices can help in timely spotting these issues in most of cases.</div>

<div><strong><span style="font-size:16px;">Paragraph B</span></strong></div>
<div>Sojer and Henkel focused on the legal and economic risks of code reuse from the Internet. They surveyed 869 professional software developers to investigate if the reuse of code snippets from internet is a common practice in commercial software development. They found that the 88% developers reuse internet code and the 19% of them consider reuse as a very important activity for their work. Furthermore, the analysis shows a growth in the importance of internet code reuse in recent years.</div>

<div>Sojer and Henkel focused on the legal and economic risks of code reuse from the Internet. They surveyed 869 professional software developers to investigate if the reuse of code snippets from internet is a common practice in commercial software development.

<div>However, we found one case in Apache httpd documentation mailing list where the traceability information between translations of a document was still managed manually, e.g., by adding a line of comment at top of translations referring to original document and more particularly "The whole point of the comment is to see which exact revisions of the original file you have to diff to see the changes.".</div>

<div>Interestingly, in another thread of the Apache httpd mailing list they discuss an issue of harmful warning messages originating from meta-information they also use to enforce up-to-dateness of different translations.

<div>Interestingly, we observed that developers adopt preventative solutions to ensure the up-to-dateness of the project's documentation. For example, some projects have added documentation up-to-dateness as one of the items to check in the contribution to-do list, and others have pushed this forward by making Javadoc update mandatory for pull request acceptance.</div>
