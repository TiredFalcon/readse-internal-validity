However, the main purpose of those code refactoring/clean up tasks is to improve the code comprehensibility without touching any documentation. Variable and method renaming refactoring (i.e., renaming a variable or method to better fit its functionality) is the most common way to make the code easier to understand. Also, variable and method extract refactoring (i.e., replacing literal values or inner method code blocks by introducing new variables or methods) is a standard approach to not only avoid existing or potential redundant code, but also better present and explain the implementation logic of the extracted code snippets.

Variable and method renaming refactoring (i.e., renaming a variable or method to better reflect its functionality) is the most common way to make the code easier to comprehend. Also popular are code transformations aimed at replacing literal values with variables or splitting long functions through extract method refactoring. The latter allows not only to foster comprehensibility, but also the reusability of small code snippets.

For researchers, this is an opportunity to study test breaking-changes and to develop techniques able to alert the developer when a change she implemented might require a double check of (part of) the test suite. For practitioners, continuous integration practices can help in timely spotting these issues in most of cases.

The empirical studies in the literature can be classified based on their main goal into five broad categories: Studies (i) investigating the importance and impact of documentation in the software life cycle; (ii) describing developers issues and concerns when dealing with software documentation; (iii) investigating the quality attributes required in documentation artifacts; (iv) providing guidelines and recommendations on how to write and maintain documentation; and (v) proposing frameworks and tools for assessing developers' concerns in this context.

(Empirical) Studies. A variety of empirical studies have targeted software documentation artifacts aiming at (i) investigating its importance and impact in software life cycle, (ii) describing developers issues and concerns when dealing with software documentation, (iii) investigating the quality attributes required in documentation artifacts, (iv) providing guidelines and recommendations for constructing it, and (v) proposing frameworks and tools for assessing developers' concern in this context (such as cost, benefit and quality attributes).

Referring to deprecated information is also one of the main reasons for up-to-dateness issues, and can affect several types of documentation in different ways: It includes having deprecated information in the project's website (e.g.,**""homepage recommends deprecated commands""), outdated copyright information and version numbers in the code base, as well as outdated references (e.g., links to old versions of the system in the documentation), which was the most prevalent issue within this category. For example, one user reported that ""the example linked in the documentation is using the 3.x version of the API, and that may be confusing to readers"".
